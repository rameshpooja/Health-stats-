Task 1 :

Apply natural visibility graph (NVG) and horizontal visibility graph (HVG) to the aforementioned data
Compute average degree, network diameter, and average path length
For the above computations select sample size of 1024 data points ( from 1000 to 2024) for each of the 15 time series
Tabulate all the results
Generate scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points according to walking and running (do this for each accelerometer signal and each method (HVH and NVG))
Generate scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points according to climbing up and climbing down (do this for each accelerometer signal and each method (HVH and NVG))

Task 2 :
