# Health Statistics task 

Task 1 :

Apply natural visibility graph (NVG) and horizontal visibility graph (HVG) to the aforementioned data. 
Compute average degree, network diameter, and average path length.
For the above computations select sample size of 1024 data points ( from 1000 to 2024) for each of the 15 time series.

Generate scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points according to walking and running (do this for each accelerometer signal and each method (HVH and NVG)).
Generate scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points according to climbing up and climbing down (do this for each accelerometer signal and each method (HVH and NVG)).

Task 2 :

Compute permutation entropy and complexity for the aforementioned data.
Consider the accelerometer data in all three directions .Vary the following parameters Embedded Dimension 3, 4, 5, 6 Embedded Delay 1, 2, 3 Signal length 1024, 2048, 4096.

Generate scatter plots: permutation entropy vs complexity and color the points according to walking and running (for signal length =4096, embedded delay = 1, and embedded dimension = 3, 4, 5, 6, and all three accelerometer directions).

Generate scatter plots: permutation entropy vs complexity and color the points according to climbing up and climbing down (for signal length =4096, embedded delay = 1, and embedded dimension = 3, 4, 5, 6, all three accelerometer directions).
